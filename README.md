# koup
I created koup because my friends and I wanted to play Coup when we were outside (e.g. at a restaurant), but didn't have any playing cards to use.

Koup is *not* designed to be a method of playing Coup online. Rather, it is an augmentation of real-life play that allows you to use your phone as the "cards". You can then perform the same actions on those cards as you would normally. It also helps you manage your coins (so you don't need to count) and does the shuffling of the deck for you (read: hassle free)!

## Todo
- Have proper error handling (currently does an alert)
- Change favicon
- Other things that are marked TODO in the comments
